Version 1.0.1
-------------
- Bug partially fixed on the tkrplot package. We changed this package from the Imports field to Suggests in DESCRIPTION. But, this needs to be improved.


Version 1.0
-----------
- In the first version, we created the basic functions of the MCP package:
  * MCPtest()
  * MCPwrite()
  * plot.MCP()
  * guiMCP()
- We added parallelization for some tests
